# CricStatz
As a part of my freshman year computer programming course CS110, my team and I created a Cricket match scoring system using concepts of C Programming. It is a user friendly system and every detail of a real life cricket match is incorporated with 'as seen on TV' display of scorecard and preliminary stats.

main.c is the main code while venuedetails.c is an auxiliary code and uses the concept of file handling in C.

Please execute venuedetails.c first before executing main.c
