# CricStatz-Code
As a part of my freshman year computer programming course CS110, my team and I created a Cricket match scoring system using concepts of C Programming. It is a user friendly system and every detail of a real life cricket match is incorporated with 'as seen on TV' display of scorecard and preliminary stats.
